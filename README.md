# Ethereum Contract - Angular UI

Project created in order to interact with the contract generated in my [Ethereum Lottery Contract Repository](https://github.com/maxicandelero/ethereum-contracts-lottery)

## Play with the App

Run `npm install` and then `npm start`. You should have the MetaMask extension installed in your browser and remember to use a test network.
